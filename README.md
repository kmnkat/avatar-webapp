# avatar-webapp
## my final project from the Code First Girl course

It's a simple avatar generator which allows user to download the result.
I created this project during the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) Introduction to Web Development course. 

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm (express.js and nodemon are required):
```
$ npm start
```
